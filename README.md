## FAQ

**Can I change the image that is displayed?**  
I mean… it's just a `UIImageView`, so, yes.

**Uh, I meant, are there other pre-built images?**  
No. This image was hand-selected by a crack team of 90s Under Construction GIF experts.

**I'm Uncle Lawyer from Nintendo, and I ask that you cease and desist these Pokémon-related shenanigans.**  
Ugh. Fine. Can I get some Zelda swag?

**I'm 90s GIF creator xXRadDude182Xx. I created this image, and I ask that you cease and desist these animated shenanigans.**  
Ugh. Fine. Can I get some Geocities swag?
